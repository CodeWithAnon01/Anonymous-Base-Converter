            <h2 id="importanceX">Importance of Number Systems</h2>
            <p>Number system in computer The most commonly used number system is the binary system, also known as the base-2 number system. The binary system uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent all numbers and data.
<br> <br>
                Binary numbers are used extensively in digital electronics and computing because it is easy to represent them using switches, where 0 represents "off" and 1 represents "on." This makes it possible to store and manipulate data electronically using digital circuits.
         <br><br>       
                These systems are often used for representing and manipulating large binary numbers or for expressing memory addresses in a compact and easy-to-read format. Computer programs and programming languages use number system concepts to perform arithmetic operations, store data, and communicate with hardware devices.</p>

            <h2 id="what_is_ict">What is ICT?</h2>
            <p>Information and communications technology (ICT) is an extensional term for information technology (IT) that stresses the role of unified communications and the integration of telecommunications (telephone lines and wireless signals) and computers, as well as necessary enterprise software, middleware, storage and audiovisual, that enable users to access, store, transmit, understand and manipulate information. <br>
                <br>
                ICT is also used to refer to the convergence of audiovisuals and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or link system. There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone networks with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling, signal distribution, and management. ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing radio, television, cell phones, computer and network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and appliances with them such as video conferencing and distance learning. ICT also includes analog technology, such as paper communication, and any mode that transmits communication.

ICT is a broad subject and the concepts are evolving. It covers any product that will store, retrieve, manipulate, process, transmit, or receive information electronically in a digital form (e.g., personal computers including smartphones, digital television, email, or robots). Skills Framework for the Information Age is one of many models for describing and managing competencies for ICT professionals in the 21st century.
